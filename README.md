## Description

This is a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:
* _Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"_
* _Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"_
* _Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_

## Project Specs

* Program breaks down the inputted number into an array
  _Example Input: 10_
  _Example Output: [0, 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]_

* Program replaces all 0 with "Beep!"
  _Example input: 0_
  _Example Output: ["Beep!"]_

* Program replaces all numbers with 1's with "Boop!"
  _Example input: 1_
  _Example Output: ["Boop!"]_

* Program replaces all numbers divisible by 3 with text
  _Example input: "3"_
  _Example Output: (I'm sorry Dave I just can't do that)_

* Program breaks down the inputted number into an array counting up to the inputted number
  _Example input: 10_
  _Example Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]_    

* Program will run through the new array applying rules (1-3) to each element of the array.
  _Example input: 4_
  _Example output: [Beep, Boop, "Im sorry Dave I just can't do that",4,5]_
* Program will the the converted  array, push it to a string, and give it back to the user as _Robo_ language.
